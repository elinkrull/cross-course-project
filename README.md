Brief - Interaction Design

In this assignment you will work on your cross-course project (Rainy Days, Gamehub, SquareEyes) to:

Test the usability of your website and see where you can improve the overall interaction.

Level 1 Process
Consider conducting a usability test with the following methods:

In-person
Remote
Guerilla
In-person testing is more formal and empathetic so that you, as a moderator, acknowledge the user’s experience. Remote testing allows users to test the website from their own environment. Guerilla testing is less formal and can essentially be done anywhere with a small group of users for approximately 10 minutes. Whichever method you decide to use, set a goal and prepare your questions.

Plan which method is best for you and conduct your test. Observe the users and collect data. Once you’ve collected the data, decide what could be improved to enhance your website, and then go implement those changes using your skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Once you’ve added your changes, test the site with at least one more user (preferably 3-5). Gain feedback from the user and determine whether the changes you’ve made have improved the interaction on the website.

Perform accessibility testing on your website to ensure it’s easy to use for users with accessibility issues.

Write a report detailing the usability test you conducted during this course, and include the changes you made to your website.

Requirements
Because your sites will all have slightly different designs, the areas that need improvement will be different. But by the end of the course assignment, you should have conducted a usability test and made improvements where needed. Recommended tools to use include WAVE and Hotjar.

Submission
