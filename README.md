## Description

The purpose of this project was to put into practice everything I have learned about design,HTML and CSS.
First I had to create wireframes and build high-fidelity interactive prototypes in Figma.
I had to make one prototype for mobile-view, and one for desktop.
Then I had to make a properly functioning, responsive website.

- The HTML should be semantic and neat.
- The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
- The website should be responsive and with no horizontal scrollbars.
- The site should be WCAG compliant, and accessibility should be taken into account.
- Each page should have a unique <meta name="description">, <title>, and <h1>.

## Built With

- Figma
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
